iTunes rating made easy: Automated track rating from play statistics

This application automatically sets the rating for all tracks in your iTunes library according to how you listen to them.

Tracks you listen to more will have a higher rating; tracks you neglect will have a lower rating.

This is particularly useful for automatically creating playlists, or transferring only your favourite tracks onto your iPod.
